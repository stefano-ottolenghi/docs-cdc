= Enable CDC on self-hosted instances (on-prem)


include::partial$get-started.adoc[tags=intro]


[[set-enrichment-mode]]
== Set the enrichment mode

=== Create a database with log enrichment enabled

To create a new database with CDC enabled, use the link:https://www.neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/database-administration/standard-databases/manage-databases/#manage-databases-create[`CREATE DATABASE`] Cypher command and set the option `txLogEnrichment` to either `FULL` or `DIFF`.

.Query
[source, cypher]
----
CREATE DATABASE dbName OPTIONS {txLogEnrichment: "FULL"}
----

=== Modify a database's log enrichment mode

To tweak the enrichment mode on an existing database, use the https://www.neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/database-administration/standard-databases/manage-databases/#administration-databases-alter-database[`ALTER DATABASE`] Cypher command and set the option `txLogEnrichment` to either `FULL` or `DIFF`.

.Query
[source, cypher]
----
ALTER DATABASE dbName SET OPTION txLogEnrichment "DIFF"
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Modifying enrichment mode from `DIFF` to `FULL` or viceversa immediately changes the  xref:procedures/output-schema.adoc[structure of captured changes].
Your CDC application must be able to deal with the different format.
====

[[get-enrichment-mode]]
=== Get a database's log enrichment mode

To see what value the enrichment mode of a database is, use the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/database-administration/standard-databases/manage-databases/#manage-databases-list[`SHOW DATABASES`] Cypher command.

.Query
[source, cypher]
----
SHOW DATABASES YIELD name, options
----


.Result
[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="1m,1m"]
|===
| name | options

| "neo4j"
| {"txLogEnrichment": "FULL"}


| "system"
| {}

|===


=== Disable log enrichment

To disable log enrichment on a database, either set `txLogEnrichment` explicitly to `OFF` or remove it altogether.

.Using set option clause
[source, cypher]
----
ALTER DATABASE dbName SET OPTION txLogEnrichment "OFF"
----

.Using remove option clause
[source, cypher]
----
ALTER DATABASE dbName REMOVE OPTION txLogEnrichment
----

[WARNING]
====
Disabling enrichment immediately breaks the continuity of change events.
**Change identifiers generated before disabling can no longer be used and, even if enrichment is re-enabled, the previously-generated change identifiers remain invalid.**
Disabling and then re-enabling CDC is equivalent to enabling it for the first time: there is no memory of previous changes.

== Points to consider

[[security]]
=== Security

CDC returns all changes in the database and is not limited to the entities which a certain user is allowed to access.
In order to prevent unauthorized access, the procedure xref:procedures/index.adoc#query[`db.cdc.query`] requires admin privileges and should be configured for least privilege access.

For a regular user to be able to run `db.cdc.query`, the user must have been granted execute privileges as well as boosted execute privileges.

[source, cypher]
----
GRANT EXECUTE PROCEDURE db.cdc.query ON DBMS TO $role;
GRANT EXECUTE BOOSTED PROCEDURE db.cdc.query ON DBMS TO $role;
----

[NOTE]
====
Non-boosted execute privileges are usually part of the `PUBLIC` role, in which case they do not need to be granted a second time.
====

Furthermore, the user does not have access to a database unless they have been granted access.

[source, cypher]
----
GRANT ACCESS ON DATABASE $database TO $role
----

[NOTE]
====
Usually the `PUBLIC` role already has access to the default database.
====

The procedures xref:procedures/index.adoc#current[`db.cdc.current`] and xref:procedures/index.adoc#earliest[`db.cdc.earliest`] do not require admin privileges. In order to execute these, access to the database and regular execution privileges are sufficient.

For more details regarding procedure privileges in Neo4j, see link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/operations-manual/{page-version}/authentication-authorization/manage-execute-permissions[Operations Manual -> Manage procedure and user-defined function permissions].


[[disk-size]]
=== Disk size

Enabling change data capture on a database causes more data to be written into transaction log files.
This means that the log files are rotated more frequently and log pruning is activated sooner (based on your configuration).
The disk may run out of space if the disk size for transaction log storage is limited, so ensure that you have plenty of available space.

In particular, **plan for a 50% increase in data written to the transaction log with `DIFF` enrichment mode, and 75% for `FULL` enrichment mode.**
Actual disk usage depends on the application, data model and transaction characteristics.


[[log-retention]]
=== Transaction log retention

Since Neo4j stores change data capture information inside transaction log entries, you should configure the transaction log retention period based on your application requirements.

The number of hours or days to keep the transaction log depends on your CDC use case, but as a general rule of thumb you can pick the period based on downtime tolerance of your downstream application so that the changes you have not yet processed are not pruned.

For more details on transaction log retention and how to configure it, see link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/operations-manual/{page-version}/configuration/transaction-logs/#transaction-logging-log-retention[Operations Manual -> Configuration -> Transaction Log].


[[non-tx-log-changes]]
=== Unrecorded changes

CDC can only capture data changes that pass through the transaction layer and any data creation that avoids this layer can therefore not be captured.
For example, when importing data with the link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/operations-manual/current/tools/neo4j-admin/neo4j-admin-import/[`neo4j-admin database import`] tool, whether full or incremental, or when loading data with the link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/operations-manual/current/backup-restore/restore-dump/[`neo4j-admin database load`] tool, data is written directly to the store without sending anything to the transaction log, so such changes are **not** captured by CDC.
