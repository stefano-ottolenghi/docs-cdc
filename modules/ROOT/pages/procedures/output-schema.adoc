= Change event schema

Contents of change events differ by the underlying entity.

== Node Changes

Change events for nodes follow this schema:

----
<1> A unique change identifier that identifies this change record.
Used as a cursor to continue querying changes from last processed change.
<2> A number identifying which transaction the change happened in, unique in combination with `seq`.
Transaction identifiers are not continuous.
Some transactions, such as system and schema commands, are not recorded in change data capture and cause gaps in the transaction identifiers.
<3> A number used for ordering changes happened in the same transaction.
Note that the order of changes observed in the output does not necessarily correspond to the order of changes applied during the transaction.
<4> The user that performed this change.
May be different from `authenticatedUser` when using impersonation.
See link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/cypher-manual/{page-version}/administration/access-control/dbms-administration/#access-control-dbms-administration-impersonation[Cypher Manual -> Administration -> Access Control -> DBMS Administration] for more information on impersonation.
<5> The authenticated user when this change was performed.
<6> The transaction log enrichment mode at the time this change was captured.
<7> The client's address (usually IP address and port but might change based on protocol).
<8> The identifier of the server that performed this change.
See link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/cypher-manual/{page-version}/administration/servers/#server-management-show-servers[Cypher Manual -> Administration -> Server management] for more information on servers.
<9> The protocol under which the client is connected through.
<10> The server's address (usually IP address and port but might change based on protocol).
<11> The timestamp when the underlying transaction started.
<12> The timestamp when the underlying transaction committed.
<13> The element id of the changed entity (node or relationship).
See link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/cypher-manual/{page-version}/functions/scalar/#functions-elementid[Cypher Manual -> Functions -> Scalar functions] for more information on element ids.
<14> The keys identifying the changed entity.
Requires specific constraint types defined on entities, see xref:getting-started/constraints.adoc[] for details.
<15> Type of the changed entity: `n` for nodes and `r` for relationships.
<16> A map describing the state of the entity before the change.
This field is always `NULL` for create events.
When on `DIFF` enrichment mode, it is limited to the properties and labels of the entity that have changed.
See xref:getting-started/enrichment-mode.adoc#enrichment-mode[enrichment mode] for details.
This field always contains the full state of the entity for delete events, regardless of the enrichment mode being set to `DIFF` or `FULL`.
<17> A map describing the state of the entity after the change.
This field is always `NULL` for delete events.
When on `DIFF` enrichment mode, it is limited to the properties and labels of the entity that have changed.
See xref:getting-started/enrichment-mode.adoc#enrichment-mode[enrichment mode] for details.
This field always contains the full state of the entity for create events, regardless of the enrichment mode being set to `DIFF` or `FULL`.
<18> A map of properties of the entity after the change.
<19> List of labels of the node after the change has been applied.
When on `DIFF` enrichment mode, it is limited to the changed labels.
See xref:getting-started/enrichment-mode.adoc#enrichment-mode[enrichment mode] for details.
<20> Type of the operation: `c` for creates, `u` for updates, and `d` for deletions.
<21> List of labels of the changed node.
This list is always populated from the `before` state of the node.
It contains the complete set of labels regardless of the enrichment mode.


== Relationship changes
Change events for relationships follow a similar schema to node changes.
Note that only the differences are annotated below.

<1> A map containing information about the start node.
<2> Element id of the start node.
<3> Keys (if related constraints are defined) of the start node.
<4> List of labels of the start node.
<5> Same set of information defined above for the end node.
<6> Since relationships do not have labels, there is no field for labels in the before / after state.
<7> Relationship type.
